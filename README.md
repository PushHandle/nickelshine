# nickelshine.com

This uses Github Pages to quickly deploy an index.html to the domain (on name.com)

Its intended to be a single static html page to verify LLC information during application reviews.

Here are a few things to know:

1. CNAME record on Name.com points to pushhandle.github.io 
2. Titan Email is provided at annual fee by Name.com
3. Name.com DNS flow suggested Titan Email records would not work with CNAME
4. So far it is working just fine
5. Email can be logged into at https://app.titan.email/
6. Titan email has a mobile app
7. The basic content for this page was borrowed from a few other registration verification sites
8. Heroku is brutal and costly for simple site hosting
